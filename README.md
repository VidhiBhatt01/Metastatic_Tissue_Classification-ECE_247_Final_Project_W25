# **Metastatic Tissue Classification**

## **Project Overview üñ•Ô∏è**
Histopathologists rely on microscopic imaging of lymph nodes to identify metastatic cancer, a process that is often subjective and varies between experts. This project aims to enhance the objectivity and accuracy of metastatic tissue classification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques on the **PatchCamelyon dataset**, a publicly available collection of histopathologic scans.

We explore traditional ML models such as **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, alongside advanced DL architectures like **ResNets**, **InceptionNet**, **EfficientNet**, and **U-Net**. Additionally, we investigate post-CNN architectures, including **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**, to assess their potential for improved classification performance. Given the importance of model interpretability in medical applications, we also employ **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)** to visualize the regions of an image that contribute most to the model‚Äôs predictions, enhancing explainability.

By leveraging AI for cancer detection, our goal is to contribute to the development of objective, automated diagnostic tools that can aid pathologists in identifying metastatic cells more reliably and efficiently.
